# License & model notes
- **BioMedLM**: check Stanford/CRFM model card on Hugging Face for license (research vs commercial). Do not assume commercial use allowed.
- **AlphaFold / OpenFold**: AlphaFold2 code is open; AlphaFold DB is free for research. Check DeepMind licensing for latest terms.
- **ESM-2**: Meta released weights; check repo for license and usage terms.
- **MegaMolBART / NVIDIA NeMo**: check NVIDIA repo for license and terms. Some checkpoints may have non-commercial clauses.
- **DiffDock**: check authors' repo and model card.

Always review each model's LICENSE and model card before deploying in production or using commercially.
